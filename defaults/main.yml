# The base container network
#
# Official recommendations are to run this container with `--net=host`,
# but we don't do that, since it:
# - exposes the metrics web server way too publicly (we'd potentially like to add HTTP Basic Auth, etc.)
# - or listens on a loopback interface only (--net=host and 127.0.0.1:9100), which is not reachable from a local Prometheus container
#
# Not using `--net=host` means that our network statistic reports are likely broken (inaccurate),
# because blackbox-exporter can't see all interfaces, etc.
# For now, we'll live with that, until someone develops a better solution.
